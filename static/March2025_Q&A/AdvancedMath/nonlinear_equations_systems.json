  "answer": "120",
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 120. The solutions to a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0 can be calculated using the quadratic formula and are given by x = (-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac))/(2a). The given equation is in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = -8, and c = -7. It follows that the solutions to the given equation are x = (8 ± sqrt((-8)²-4(2)(-7)))/(2(2)), which is equivalent to x = (8 ± sqrt(64+56))/4, or x = (8 ± sqrt(120))/4. It's given that one solution to the equation 2x² - 8x - 7 = 0 can be written as (8 - sqrt(k))/4. The solution (8 - sqrt(120))/4 is in this form. Therefore, the value of k is 120."

  "answer": "35/2",
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 35/2. Subtracting the second equation from the first equation yields (y+k)-(y-k)=x+26-(x²-5x), or 2k=-x²+6x+26. This is equivalent to x²-6x+(2k-26)=0. It's given that the system has exactly one distinct real solution; therefore, this equation has exactly one distinct real solution. An equation of the form ax²+bx+c=0, where a, b, and c are constants, has exactly one distinct real solution when the discriminant, b²-4ac, is equal to 0. The equation x²-6x+(2k-26)=0 is of this form, where a=1, b=-6, and c=2k-26. Substituting these values into the discriminant, b²-4ac, yields (-6)²-4(1)(2k-26). Setting the discriminant equal to 0 yields (-6)²-4(1)(2k-26)=0, or -8k+140=0. Subtracting 140 from both sides of this equation yields -8k=-140. Dividing both sides of this equation by -8 yields k=35/2. Note that 35/2 and 17.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."

  "answer": "14",
  "explanation": "The correct answer is 14. It's given by the first equation of the system of equations that y = -2.5. Substituting -2.5 for y in the second given equation, y = x² + 8x + k, yields -2.5 = x² + 8x + k. Adding 2.5 to both sides of this equation yields 0 = x² + 8x + k + 2.5. A quadratic equation of the form 0 = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, has no real solutions if and only if its discriminant, b²-4ac, is negative. In the equation 0 = x² + 8x + k + 2.5, where k is a positive integer constant, a = 1, b = 8, and c = k + 2.5. Substituting 1 for a, 8 for b, and k + 2.5 for c in b²-4ac yields 8²-4(1)(k + 2.5), or 64-4(k + 2.5). Since this value must be negative, 64-4(k + 2.5) < 0. Adding 4(k + 2.5) to both sides of this inequality yields 64 < 4(k + 2.5). Dividing both sides of this inequality by 4 yields 16 < k + 2.5. Subtracting 2.5 from both sides of this inequality yields 13.5 < k. Since k is a positive integer constant, the least possible value of k is 14."

  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Since a product of two factors is equal to 0 if and only if at least one of the factors is 0, either 5x + 4 = 0 or 2x - 5 = 0. Subtracting 4 from each side of the equation 5x + 4 = 0 yields 5x = -4. Dividing each side of this equation by 5 yields x = -4/5. Adding 5 to each side of the equation 2x - 5 = 0 yields 2x = 5.

  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Multiplying each side of the given equation by 1/20 yields 1/20(20/p)=1/20(20/q-20/r-20/s). Distributing 1/20 on each side of this equation yields 20/20p=20/20q-20/20r-20/20s, or 1/p=1/q-1/r-1/s. Adding 1/r+1/s to each side of this equation yields 1/p+1/r+1/s=1/q. Multiplying 1/p by prs/prs, 1/r by prs/prs, and 1/s by prs/prs yields prs/pr+ps+rs+prs/pr+ps+rs+prs/pr+ps+rs=1/q, which is equivalent to pr+ps+rs/prs=1/q. Since pr+ps+rs/prs=1/q and it's given that p, q, r, and s are positive, it follows that the reciprocals of each side of this equation are also equal. Thus, prs/pr+ps+rs=q, or prs/pr+ps+rs=q.
