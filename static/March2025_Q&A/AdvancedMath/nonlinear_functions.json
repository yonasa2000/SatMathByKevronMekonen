  "answer":  "A) The estimated value of the tablet was $225 when it was purchased.",
  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that the graph shown gives the estimated value y, in dollars, of a tablet as a function of the number of months since it was purchased, x. The y-intercept of a graph is the point at which the graph intersects the y-axis, or when x is 0. The graph shown intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 225). It follows that 0 months after the tablet was purchased, or when the tablet was purchased, the estimated value of the tablet was 225 dollars. Therefore, the best interpretation of the y-intercept is that the estimated value of the tablet was $225 when it was purchased. Choice B is incorrect. The estimated value of the tablet 24 months after it was purchased was $50, not $225. Choice C is incorrect. The estimated value of the tablet had decreased by $225 - $50, or $175, not $225, in the 24 months after it was purchased. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors."

  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. When a graph is translated up 4 units, each point on the resulting graph is 4 units above the point on the original graph. In other words, the y-value of each point on the graph increases by 4. The graph shown passes through the points (1, -1), (2, -2), and (3, -1). It follows that when the graph shown is translated up 4 units, the resulting graph will pass through the points (1, -1 + 4), (2, -2 + 4), and (3, -1 + 4). These points are (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 3), respectively. Of the given choices, only the graph in choice A passes through the points (1, 3), (2, 2), and (3, 3). Choice B is incorrect. This is the result of translating the graph down, rather than up, 4 units. Choice C is incorrect. This is the result of translating the graph left, rather than up, 4 units. Choice D is incorrect.

  "answer": "D) Neither I nor II",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. A y-intercept of a graph in the xy-plane is a point where the graph intersects the y-axis, or a point where x=0. Substituting 0 for x in the equation defining function f yields f(0)=a(2.2^0+2.2^b), or f(0)=a(1+2.2^b). So, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph is a(1+2.2^b), or equivalently, a+a(2.2^b). It's given that function g is equivalent to function f, where 0<a<b. It follows that k=2.2^b. Since a(2.2^b) can't be equal to 0, the coefficient a can't be equal to a+a(2.2^b). Since 0<a, the constant k, which is equal to 2.2^b, can't be equal to a+a(2.2^b). Therefore, function g doesn't display the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=f(x) in the xy-plane as a constant or coefficient. It's also given that function h is equivalent to function f, where 0<a<b. The equation defining f can be rewritten as f(x)=a(2.2^x)+a(2.2^b). It follows that m=a(2.2^b). Since a(2.2^b) can't be equal to 0, the coefficient a can't be equal to a+a(2.2^b). Since 0<a, the constant m, which is equal to a(2.2^b), can't be equal to a+a(2.2^b). Therefore, function h doesn't display the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=f(x) in the xy-plane as a constant or coefficient. Thus, neither function g nor function h displays the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=f(x) in the xy-plane as a constant or coefficient.

  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The vertex of the graph of a quadratic equation is where it reaches its minimum or maximum value. When a quadratic equation is written in the form y = a(x - h)² + k, the vertex of the parabola represented by the equation is (x, y) = (h, k). In the given equation y = -16(x - 5.6)² + 502, the value of h is 5.6 and the value of k is 502. It follows that the vertex of the graph of this equation in the xy-plane is (x, y) = (5.6, 502). Additionally, since a = -16 in the given equation, the graph of the quadratic equation opens down, and the vertex represents a maximum. It's given that the value of y represents the estimated height, in feet, of the toy rocket x seconds after it is launched into the air. Therefore, this toy rocket reaches an estimated maximum height of 502 feet 5.6 seconds after it is launched into the air. Choice A is incorrect. The 16 in the equation is an indicator of how narrow the graph of the equation is rather than where it reaches its maximum. Choice C is incorrect.

The table shows that when x=0, g(x)=1. Substituting 0 for x and 1 for g(x) in the equation g(x)=a(b)^x yields 1=a(b)^0, which is equivalent to 1=a.

  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The table shows an increasing exponential relationship between the number of years, x, since Hana started training in pole vault and the estimated height h(x), in meters, of her best pole vault for that year. The relationship can be written as h(x)=Ca^x, where C and a are positive constants. It's given that when x=0, h(x)=1.23. Substituting 0 for x and 1.23 for h(x) in h(x)=Ca^x yields 1.23=Ca^0, or 1.23=C. Substituting 1.23 for C in h(x)=Ca^x yields h(x)=1.23a^x. It's also given that when x=2, h(x)=1.54. Substituting 2 for x and 1.54 for h(x) in h(x)=1.23a^x yields 1.54=1.23a². Dividing each side of this equation by 1.23 yields 1.54/1.23=1.23a²/1.23, or a² is approximately equal to 1.252. Since a is positive, a is approximately equal to sqrt(1.252), or 1.12. Substituting 1.12 for a in h(x)=1.23a^x yields h(x)=1.23(1.12)^x. Choice A is incorrect.

Since the coefficient of the x^2-term is positive, the graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane opens upward and reaches its minimum value at its vertex. For an equation in the form f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is -b/2a. For the equation f(x)=x^2-90x + 2,024, a=1, b=-90, and c = 2,024.

The time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria to double is the increase in the value of t that causes the expression 2t/70 to double. Since the base is 2, the expression 2t/70 will double when the exponent increases by 1. Since the exponent of this expression is t/70, the exponent will increase by 1 when t increases by 70.

It follows that the banner's width, in inches, can be represented by the expression x - 24. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and its width.

Substituting 3364 for h(t) and 0 for t in the function h yields 3364 = -16(0)^2 + b, or 3364 = b. Substituting 3364 for b in the function h yields h(t)=-16t^2 + 3364. When the object hits the ground, its height will be 0 feet above the ground. Substituting 0 for h(t) in h(t)=-16t^2 + 3364 yields 0 = -16t^2 + 3364. Adding 16t^2 to each side of this equation yields 16t^2 = 3364. Dividing each side of this equation by 16 yields t^2 = 210.25. Since the object will hit the ground at a positive number of seconds after it's dropped, the value of t can be found by taking the positive square root of each side of this equation, which yields t = 14.50.

  "explanation": "The correct answer is −13/2. The value of x for which f(x) reaches its minimum can be found by rewriting the given equation in the form f(x) = (x − h)2 + 13x + 2, can be rewritten as f(x) = x2 + 13x + __) − __ + 2. By completing the square, this equation can be rewritten as f(x) = (x^2 + 13x + 169/4) − 169/4 + 2 = (x + 13/2)^2 − 121/4, which is equivalent to f(x) = (x + 13/2)^2 − 289/4 or f(x) = (x − (−13/2))^2 − 289/4. Therefore, f(x) reaches its minimum when the value of x is −13/2. Note that −13/2 and −6.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer. Another way to determine the value of x for which the function f(x) reaches its minimum is to use the fact that the graph of f(x) is a parabola. The value of x for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the graph. The x-intercepts of a parabola in the form y = (x − a)(x − b) are a and b. It follows that the x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane occur when x = −2 and x = −15, or at the points (−2, 0) and (−15, 0). The midpoint between two points, (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), is ((x₁ + x₂)/2, (y₁ + y₂)/2). Therefore, f(x) reaches its minimum when the value of x is (−2 + (−15))/2 = −17/2 = −13/2. Note that −13/2 and −6.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."

  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. For the function f, since the base of the exponent, 1.25, is greater than 1, the value of (1.25)^x increases as x increases. Therefore, the value of f(x) = 18(1.25)^x + 41 also increases as x increases. Since f is therefore an increasing function where x ≥ 0, the function f has no maximum value. For the function g, since the base of the exponent, 0.73, is less than 1, the value of (0.73)^x decreases as x increases. Therefore, the value of g(x) = 9(0.73)^x also decreases as x increases. It follows that the maximum value of g(x) for x ≥ 0 occurs when x = 0. Substituting 0 for x in the function g yields g(0) = 9(0.73)^0, which is equivalent to g(0) = 9(1), or g(0) = 9. Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) for x ≥ 0 is 9, which appears as a coefficient in equation II. So, of the two equations given, only II displays, as a constant or coefficient, the maximum value of the function it defines, where x ≥ 0. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The number that’s 8 more than x can be represented by the expression x + 8. It’s given that the product of x and x + 8 is 180, so it follows that (x)(x + 8) = 180, or x² + 8x = 180. Subtracting 180 from each side of this equation gives x² + 8x − 180 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields (x − 10)(x + 18) = 0. Applying the zero product property to this equation yields two solutions: x = 10 and x = −18. Since x is a positive number, the value of x is 10. Choice A is incorrect. If x = 5, the product of x and the number that’s 8 more than x would be (5)(13), or 65, not 180. Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of the number that’s 8 more than x, not the value of x. Choice D is incorrect. If x = 36, the product of x and the number that’s 8 more than x would be (36)(44), or 1,584, not 180."

  "explanation": "The correct answer is 168. The quadratic function g gives the estimated depth of the seal, g(t), in meters, t minutes after the seal enters the water. It’s given that function g estimates that the seal reached its maximum depth of 302.4 meters 6 minutes after it entered the water. Therefore, function g can be expressed in vertex form as g(t) = a(t – 6)^2 + 302.4, where a is a constant. Since it’s also given that the seal reached the surface of the water after 12 minutes, g(12) = 0. Substituting 12 for t and 0 for g(t) in g(t) = a(t – 6)^2 + 302.4 yields 0 = a(12 – 6)^2 + 302.4, or 36a = –302.4. Dividing both sides of this equation by 36 gives a = –8.4. Substituting –8.4 for a in g(t) = a(t – 6)^2 + 302.4 gives g(t) = –8.4(t – 6)^2 + 302.4. Substituting 10 for t in g(t) gives g(10) = –8.4(10 – 6)^2 + 302.4, which is equivalent to g(10) = –8.4(4)^2 + 302.4, or g(10) = 168. Therefore, the estimated depth, to the nearest meter, of the seal 10 minutes after it entered the water was 168 meters."

  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. In the statement 'm(330) is approximately equal to 362,' the input of the function, 330, is the value of t, the elapsed time, in days, since the animal was born. The approximate value of the function, 362, is the predicted body mass, in kilograms, of the animal after that time has elapsed. Therefore, the predicted body mass of the animal was approximately 362 kg 330 days after it was born. Choice A is incorrect. This would be the best interpretation of the statement 'm(362) is approximately equal to 330.' Choice C is incorrect. The number 330/7 is the number of weeks, not the number of days, after the animal was born. Choice D is incorrect. This would be the best interpretation of the statement 'm(362) is approximately equal to 330/7.'"

Substituting 0 for y in the given equation yields 0 = 2(x - d)(x + d)(x + g)(x - d). By the zero product property, the solutions to this equation are x = d, x = -d, x = -g, and x = d. However, x = d and x = -d are repeated. It’s given that d and g are unique positive constants. It follows that the equation 0 = 2(x - d)(x + d)(x + g)(x - d) has 3 unique solutions: x = d, x = -d, and x = -g. Thus, the graph of the given equation has 3 distinct x-intercepts.
