  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that p represents the number of pounds of strawberries Lorenzo purchased and Lorenzo paid $1.90 per pound for the strawberries. It follows that the total amount, in dollars, Lorenzo paid for strawberries can be represented by 1.90p. It's given that Lorenzo paid $2 for the box of cereal. If Lorenzo paid a total of $9.60 for the box of cereal and strawberries, it follows that the equation 1.90p + 2 = 9.60 can be used to find p.

  "explanation": "The correct answer is 42. The expression (x + 6) is a factor of both terms on the left-hand side of the given equation. Therefore, the given equation can be written as (x + 6) (1/3 − 1/2) = −8, or (x + 6) (−1/6) = −8. Multiplying each side of this equation by −6 yields x + 6 = 48. Subtracting 6 from each side of this equation yields x = 42. Therefore, the value of x that is the solution to the given equation is 42."

  "answer": "D) 44",
  "explanation": "Choice D is correct. It's given that the bowl starts with 20 ounces of water and has 9 ounces of water remaining after a period of time has passed. The amount of water the bowl has lost during the time period can be found by subtracting the remaining amount of water from the original amount of water, which yields 20 - 9 ounces, or 11 ounces. It's uncovered, it follows that 1/4 = 11/t. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 4t yields t = 44. Therefore, the bowl has been uncovered for 44 days. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of t for the equation 1/4 = 9/t, not 1/4 = 11/t."
