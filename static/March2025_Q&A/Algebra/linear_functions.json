  "explanation": "Choice C is correct. It's given that the function f is defined by f(x) = 25x + 30. Substituting 2 for x in this equation yields f(2) = 25(2) + 30, which is equivalent to f(2) = 50 + 30, or f(2) = 80. Therefore, the value of f(x) is 80 when x = 2.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This is the value of 25(2), not 25(2) + 30.\nChoice B is incorrect. This is the value of 25 + 2 + 30, not 25(2) + 30.\nChoice D is incorrect. This is the value of (25 + 30)(2), not 25(2) + 30."

  "explanation": "Choice A is correct. For the linear function f, it’s given that f(7) = 28. Substituting 7 for x and 28 for f(x) in the given function yields 28 = 4(7) + b, or 28 = 28 + b. Subtracting 28 from each side of this equation yields 0 = b. Therefore, the value of b is 0.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Substituting 1 for b in the given function yields f(x) = 4x + 1.

  "explanation": "The correct answer is 67. It is given that f(5) = 32. Therefore, for the given function f, when x = 5, f(x) = 32. Substituting 5 for x and 32 for f(x) in the given function f(x) = 4x + k(x − 1) yields 32 = 4(5) + k(5 − 1), or 32 = 20 + 4k. Subtracting 20 from each side of this equation yields 12 = 4k. Dividing each side of this equation by 4 yields k = 3. Substituting 3 for k in the given function f(x) = 4x + k(x − 1) yields f(x) = 4x + 3(x − 1), which is equivalent to f(x) = 4x + 3x − 3, or f(x) = 7x − 3. Substituting 10 for x into this equation yields f(10) = 7(10) − 3, or f(10) = 67. Therefore, the value of f(10) is 67."

  "explanation": "Choice B is correct. An equation that defines a linear function f can be written in the form f(x) = mx + b, where m and b are constants. It's given in the table that when x = -4, f(x) = 0. So 0 = m(-4) + b implies that 0 = -4m + b. Adding 4m to both sides yields b = 4m. Substituting 4m for b gives f(x) = mx + 4m. It's also given that when x = 19/5, f(x) = 5. So 5 = m(19/5) + 4m. Multiplying both sides by 5 yields 25 = 19m + 20m, or 25 = 39m. Solving for m gives m = 25/39. Substituting 5 for m in f(x) = mx + 4m gives f(x) = 5x + 20. Since h(x) = f(x) + 7, then h(x) = (5x + 20) + 7 = 5x + 27.\n\nChoice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice C is incorrect and may result from calculation error.\nChoice D is incorrect.
